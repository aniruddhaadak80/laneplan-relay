# LanePlan Relay overview

## When to use this

You are orienting yourself in LanePlan Relay and need the map, not the detail.

## The one idea

Every capability in LanePlan Relay is a **Tool** registered in exactly one registry. The CLI,
the web app, the MCP server, and every channel adapter are thin transports over that one
registry. There is no second code path.

## Steps

1. Run `laneplan doctor` — it probes every subsystem and prints a fix hint per failing row.
2. Run `laneplan tools --json` — the authoritative list of capabilities.
3. Read `docs/architecture.md` for the narrow waist and the footprint ladder.

## Where capability belongs

In order of preference. Adding to the core registry is the _last_ option, not the first:

1. Extend an existing tool
2. Add a CLI command plus a skill
3. Add a service-gated tool with a `check_fn`
4. Add a plugin
5. Add an MCP server tool to the catalog
6. Add a new core tool

## Verify

`laneplan doctor` exits 0 and `laneplan tools --json` lists at least one tool.
